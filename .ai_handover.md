## Changes Implemented
- `app/privacy-policy/page.tsx`, `app/terms-of-service/page.tsx`, `app/accessibility/page.tsx`: Added fully composed legal pages (privacy, terms, accessibility) with WCAG-focused layouts, accurate last-updated stamps, regional scopes, and required sections (data collection, usage, sharing, security, rights, cookies, service terms, dispute process, etc.).
- `components/forms/FormLegalNotice.tsx` and every consumer form component (contact, quote variants, hero quick quote, career application, advanced quote modal, inline forms) now render a shared disclosure linking to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service to satisfy consent requirements.
- `components/Footer.tsx`: Replaced the legacy lower footer strip with the mandated dark-mode legal nav that surfaces Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Accessibility, and Sitemap links alongside an updated © notice.
- `app/sitemap.ts`: Added `/privacy-policy`, `/terms-of-service`, and `/accessibility` to the generated sitemap so search engines index the new legal resources.
- `middleware.ts`: Introduced 301 redirects from `/legal/privacy` → `/privacy-policy` and `/legal/terms` → `/terms-of-service` so legacy URLs automatically resolve to the canonical pages without SEO duplication.
- Removed the legacy `app/legal/privacy` and `app/legal/terms` directories so only the canonical legal content remains, and confirmed via `npm run build | grep -E "accessibility|privacy|terms"` that the build outputs exactly those three routes.

## Architectural Logic
- Dedicated route files keep legal content server-rendered and cacheable, and centralizing contact metadata through `CONTACT_INFO` prevents drift across the new documents.
- The reusable `FormLegalNotice` component gives every form an identical disclosure without duplicating markup, ensuring future forms can opt-in with a single import.
- Moving footer navigation into a distinct, high-contrast block makes compliance links consistently discoverable on every page while preserving the Apple-style primary footer layout.
- Updating the sitemap ensures crawlers and automated audits immediately recognize the new canonical legal URLs, which is critical for enterprise procurement reviews.

## Test Instructions
1. **Route Smoke Test**
   - Run `npm run dev`, visit `/privacy-policy`, `/terms-of-service`, and `/accessibility`, and verify each page loads, displays the February 20, 2025 last-updated stamp, and contains all mandated sections.
2. **Legacy Redirect Verification**
   - Manually hit `/legal/privacy` and `/legal/terms`; ensure they 301 redirect to the new canonical URLs.
3. **Footer Verification**
   - From any page (desktop + mobile widths), confirm the new dark footer block displays Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Accessibility, and Sitemap links and that each link routes correctly.
4. **Form Consent Check**
   - Submit-test the major forms (`/contact`, `/quote`, hero quick quote, career application modal) and ensure the consent paragraph appears beneath the submit controls with functioning links.
5. **Sitemap Inspection**
   - Visit `/sitemap.xml` in the browser (or curl it) to confirm the new legal URLs are listed and that no `/legal/*` entries remain.

No automated test suite was executed; please run targeted smoke tests if additional assurance is required.
