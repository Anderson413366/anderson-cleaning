## Changes Implemented
- `lib/constants.ts`, `components/sections/StatsBar.tsx`, `app/about/page.tsx`, `app/page.tsx`, `components/careers/CareersHero.tsx`, `app/services/[slug]/page.tsx`: introduced a single `YEARS_IN_BUSINESS` source of truth and wired it into every timeline reference so UI badges and hero copy always show the current years-since-2007 count.
- `app/services/page.tsx`, `app/about/page.tsx`, `components/maps/ServiceAreaMap.tsx`: reframed positioning copy to emphasize Western MA/Northern CT leadership and updated visualized radius to 100 miles to eliminate any implication of national operations.
- `lib/seo/jsonld.ts`, `app/layout.tsx`, `lib/services-data.ts`, `app/case-studies/page.tsx`, `public/OG-IMAGE-GUIDE.md`, `components/sections/StatsBar-README.md`, `README.md`: synchronized metadata, schema, docs, and OG guidance with the new regional/timeline narrative.
- Repository-wide text replacements (Header/Footer, legal pages, forms, career content, manifests, email templates, etc.) now consistently use the official “Anderson Cleaning Company” name instead of legacy variants; see `git status` for the full file list touched by this rename.

## Architectural Logic
- Centralizing the founding year math in `lib/constants.ts` prevents future drift; any UI just consumes `YEARS_IN_BUSINESS` so the count increments automatically each January without auditing dozens of components.
- Updating hero narratives and schema/map radius keeps messaging, structured data, and visual cues in lockstep so marketers can speak confidently about a strictly regional footprint without contradicting maps or metadata.
- Performing a single-source brand rename at the code/documentation level guarantees every surface area—SSR metadata, manifests, schema.org payloads, forms, and help docs—speaks with the same legal name, avoiding downstream trust issues with buyers who cross-check filings.

## Test Instructions
1. **Snapshot regional messaging**
   - Run `npm run dev`, visit `/services`, and confirm the hero headline/subtext references the region (Western MA/Northern CT) rather than national leadership.
2. **Verify dynamic timeline badges**
   - On `/` and `/about`, ensure the stats badge and hero paragraph render `18` (or current) years, matching the calculation `(new Date().getFullYear() - 2007)`.
   - Open any service detail (e.g., `/services/office-cleaning`) and confirm the badge reads `${years} Years in Business`.
3. **Check map + schema radius**
   - On `/services`, scroll to the map and confirm the shaded service circle covers an approximate 100-mile radius; also inspect the page source to verify `geoRadius` now reports `100 miles`.
4. **Brand consistency spot check**
   - Inspect header, footer, contact forms, and legal pages to ensure “Anderson Cleaning Company” appears everywhere (no lingering “Anderson Cleaning” or “Co.”).
